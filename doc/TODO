Data Download:
* Update script to download into openshift perstent data folder
-- Use the os.env['OPENSHIFT_DATA'](?) environment variable to find the data folder
-- This is repo/../data not repo/data/data_dumps
* Build the models.py to match the CSV
* Load into DB
-- Need to be inserted as python objects using Django calls so that it goes 
   through the ORM?
-- Build a python script, import django, build django obects, and save through
   ORM

Data import as a cron job:
* OpenShift cron cartridge for scheduled jobs
* For multiple jobs might be easier to use django-chronograph
  (so need just one cron job)

Display food data as a list on the site

Allow user to select a restaurant and see data

Allow searching for a restaurant


Long term:
* Mobile friendly
* Initial location based on user location (browser or IP)
* Add other cities: Chicago, DC
* Notification if a specific restaurante fails an inspection
* Foursquare checkin to alert on violation
* Make CLEAN_DB actually clean the DB (remove unnecessary tables)
-- Probably need it to relead a DB schema with GIS stuff
* South for migrating the database
* Backup the database (psql dump over SSH)
* Set admin email and debug email to a team mailing list
* Blob store or shared storage for uploaded files
* Use mongo for recording history of queries / what people search?
* Allow ratings and comments?
