Load into DB
* Write custom management command to do data import
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/howto/custom-management-commands/
-- Need to be inserted as python objects using Django calls so that it goes 
   through the ORM
-- Build a python script, import django, build django obects, and save through
   ORM
-- Replace data_import.py

Display data:
* Display every restaurant in the DB on the map
* Allow user to select one, and display the inspection data

Search UI:
* Django Form for letting the user search the database by restaurant name
* Display returned restaurants by address on map

Location Search:
* Allow searching within a specific radius


Clean-up Items:
* settings.py DEBUG=True, unless text file ~/data/LIVE_ENV
-- getting_started touch ~/data/LIVE_ENV
* Skeleton should only contain items which appear on every page in site
-- other items should be in base
* remove main.css since Tim's template uses style.css
* Update script to download into openshift perstent data folder
-- Use the os.env['OPENSHIFT_DATA'](?) environment variable to find the data folder
-- This is repo/../data not repo/data/data_dumps
Data import as a cron job:
* Install django-chronograph
* Configure django-chronograph to kick-off admin management command to import
* OpenShift cron cartridge for scheduled jobs--can't use on scalable app
-- Kick off job from a different server using `rhc ssh "manage.py cron"`


Long term:
* Mobile friendly
* Initial location based on user location (browser or IP)
* Add other cities: Chicago, DC
* Notification if a specific restaurante fails an inspection
* Foursquare checkin to alert on violation
* Make CLEAN_DB actually clean the DB (remove unnecessary tables)
-- Probably need it to relead a DB schema with GIS stuff
* South for migrating the database
* Backup the database (psql dump over SSH)
* Set admin email and debug email to a team mailing list
* Blob store or shared storage for uploaded files
* Use mongo for recording history of queries / what people search?
* Allow ratings and comments?
